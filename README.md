# The-Top-150-SMM2-List-Website
This is the repo for 'The Top 150 SMM2 List' designed by Pete231

Most of this stuff here in this repo is going to be for the website, ex: html files, css files, and js files. Since I still don't know much about making an API most of this site is going to be garbage and I am completely aware of this :) my goal is to at least have a functional website running.

( btw, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing lol I'm only in comp sci 2 )
